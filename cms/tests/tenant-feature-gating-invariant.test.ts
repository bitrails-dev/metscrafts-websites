// Invariant: every collection slug registered under `multiTenantPlugin({ collections })` in
// payload.config.ts MUST either be governed by `TENANT_COLLECTION_FEATURES` (so the per-tenant
// capability flag actually gates it) or appear in `INTENTIONALLY_UNGATED_COLLECTIONS` with a
// documented platform-wide reason.
//
// Why this test exists: the gating map at `TENANT_COLLECTION_FEATURES` has drifted from the
// multi-tenant collections list three times in this repo's history — first when legacy commerce
// slugs were added, again when plugin-first `store-*` slugs shipped (Wave B4), and a third time
// when the policy collections shipped (Wave C4). Each drift silently meant the `commerce` feature
// flag stopped governing a set of tenant-owned collections, leaving them editable by tenant-admins
// of non-commerce tenants and hiding the `tenant` ownership column in super-admin aggregate lists.
//
// This test makes the source of truth (the multi-tenant plugin's `collections` argument) the
// referee: any new tenant-owned collection MUST be added to one of the two lists. Failures here are
// a signal to update the gate map when introducing a tenant-scoped collection, not to weaken the test.
